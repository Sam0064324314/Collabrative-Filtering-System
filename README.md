# Collabrative-Filtering-System
Built a user-user collaborative filtering recommendation system using an IMDB movie dataset. This memory-based approach finds similar users from interaction data and recommends movies they liked. Implemented using scikit-learn and deployed as a simple interactive recommender web app with Streamlit.
